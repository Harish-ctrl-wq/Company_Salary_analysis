# Company Salary Analysis (Pandas Project)

## Overview  
This project is a small but realistic data analysis exercise using **Python and Pandas**.  
The focus is not on fancy visuals, but on understanding how to **clean, group, sort, and analyze data** in a way that makes sense.

The dataset is simple on purpose — the goal was to practice **core data analysis thinking**, not to hide behind complexity.

---

## Dataset  
The dataset was created as a dictionary and converted into a Pandas DataFrame.

It contains basic employee information:
- Name  
- Salary  
- Department  
- Age  

This allowed me to practice:
- Grouping and aggregation  
- Sorting values  
- Choosing the right chart for the data  

---

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Analysis Performed
Using Pandas, I performed the following steps:
- Grouped salary data by department  
- Calculated total salary per department  
- Sorted salaries to find top earners  
- Visualized results using appropriate charts

## 📸 Results & Output

Below are **actual screenshots from the Jupyter Notebook**, not generated images.

### 1. Department-wise Salary Distribution  
This pie chart shows how total salary is distributed across departments.  
It helps understand which department consumes the largest share of salary.

### 2. Top Salary Holders  
After sorting salaries in descending order, this chart highlights the top earners.  
This is a common real-world requirement in HR and finance analysis.

### 3. Name vs Salary  
A simple bar chart comparing individual salaries.  
While basic, it demonstrates correct handling of categorical vs numerical data.

## Key Observations
- HR department contributes the largest share of total salary  
- A small number of employees account for the highest salaries  
- Choosing the correct chart type is critical to avoid misleading insights  

---

## What I Learned
- Data analysis is more about **thinking clearly** than writing complex code  
- Wrong visualization choices can easily misrepresent data  
- Sorting and grouping are fundamental but powerful techniques  
- Even small datasets can be used to show correct analytical approach

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter  
3. Install required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially
